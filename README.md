# t-smartcity

## Project Description

**t-smartcity** is an intelligent application designed to empower urban planners by transforming raw data into actionable insights. By assuming the presence of an existing data pipeline, our solution streamlines data interaction and visualization to solve critical challenges in urban planning, such as data fragmentation, outdated plans, and lack of stakeholder engagement.

---

## Problem Statement

Urban planners face several challenges that hinder effective decision-making:

1. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Limited manpower and budgets restrict the ability to analyze large datasets.

2. **Fragmented Data and Long Lead Times**:
   - Collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data often takes months, delaying actionable plans.

3. **Fear and Uncertainty**:
   - Rapid technological advancements and external pressures (e.g., geopolitical, economic) create uncertainty in planning.

4. **Stakeholder Alignment**:
   - Gaining buy-in from multiple stakeholders requires consistent and clear communication, often lacking in current workflows.

## Solution Features

t-smartcity tackles these challenges with the following robust features:

### 1. **Exploratory Data Insights**
- Provides real-time insights into key urban metrics, reducing dependency on external consultants.
- Automates synchronization and onboarding processes to save time and resources.

### 2. **Predictive Modeling**
- Uses synthetic data generation to forecast future scenarios, enabling proactive decision-making.
- Machine learning models predict trends and anticipate stakeholder needs.

### 3. **Comparative Country Analysis**
- Benchmarks city performance against global standards using cross-country datasets.
- Offers dynamic visualizations to highlight actionable insights from comparative studies.

### 4. **Geospatial Visualization**
- Interactive maps display land use, meteorological patterns, and urban layouts.
- Supports IoT data integration for real-time analytics and advanced scenario planning.

### 5. **Data Privacy and Compliance**
- Anonymizes sensitive data to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
- Implements explainable AI techniques to mitigate bias and build trust.

### 6. **Agent Framework**
- Modular AI agents handle diverse tasks such as comparative analysis, report generation, and scenario planning.
- Each agent is designed to specialize in specific urban planning problems, enhancing system flexibility.

## Architecture and Scalability

### System Architecture
The application sits at the intersection of **data engineering** and **data analysis**, leveraging the following layers:
- **Data Layer**: Processes and stores structured and unstructured data (e.g., GeoJSON, CSV).
- **AI/ML Layer**: Includes agents for prediction, clustering, and scenario simulation.
- **Visualization Layer**: Generates interactive dashboards and geospatial maps.

### Scalability
- **Small Cities**:
  - Start with basic roadmaps and land-use visualizations.
- **Large Cities**:
  - Integrate IoT data, real-time analytics, and advanced predictive capabilities.
- **Future Work**:
  - Incorporate qualitative data from surveys, focus groups, and mental maps.
  - Expand to support domain-specific large language models (LLMs) and computer vision agents.
